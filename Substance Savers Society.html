				<h3> Introduction </h3>
				<p> Substance abuse is a critical issue that impacts not only individual health but also communities and society as a whole. The misuse of drugs and alcohol can lead to a range of negative effects, from mental health struggles to social and economic instability. By addressing the root causes, such as stress, peer pressure, and lack of education, we can reduce the risk of substance abuse and empower individuals to make healthier decisions for their futures. The aim is to create an environment where everyone can thrive without relying on harmful substances. </p>

				<h2>Key Facts</h2>
                <p>Barangay Mambaling in Cebu City has the highest number of drug-related killings, with 10 cases reported in one year. This is a big part of the 39 killings in Cebu City, which makes up 60% of the 65 drug-related deaths in the province. Many of the cases in Mambaling involve violence, including hitmen and mistaken identities. For example, one victim was thought to be a police informant and was killed by mistake, while another was a suspected hitman killed by police. With a population of over 30,000, Mambaling has been greatly affected by drug-related violence, showing the need for more action and support to help the community.

				<h2>Importance of Awareness </h2>
                <p>Substance abuse is a serious issue that affects not only the person involved but also their family and the community. It can lead to long-term health problems, broken relationships, and even death. In Cebu, drug-related deaths have been on the rise, with many young people getting caught in this cycle. Awareness is key to preventing substance abuse from spreading, as it helps people recognize the dangers and learn how to get help before things get worse. When we are aware, we can better protect ourselves and support others who may be struggling. </p>

				<h2>Signs and Effects of Substance Abuse</h2>
                <p>There are several signs that someone may be struggling with substance abuse. These include changes in mood, a drop in school performance, or withdrawing from family and friends. Physically, a person might experience weight changes, poor hygiene, or constant tiredness. Mentally, they may show signs of memory loss, confusion, or lack of focus. Socially, they might start isolating themselves or get into trouble more often. By spotting these signs early, we can step in to help prevent further harm and guide the person toward recovery.</p>
