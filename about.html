				<h2><strong> 1. Stay busy with hobbies and interests </strong></h2>
				<p> <u> Why</u>: When you're focused on something you enjoy, like sports, arts, or any other hobby, it keeps your mind occupied and distracted from the temptation to try drugs or alcohol. <br>
				<u> How</u>: Find an activity that excites you or challenges you, like learning an instrument, playing a sport, or volunteering. These activities not only help you stay busy but also give you a sense of achievement and joy, reducing the need for harmful substances. </p>

			<h2><strong> 2. Surround yourself with positive influences </strong></h2>
				<p> <u> Why</u>: The people you spend time with can strongly impact your decisions. Being around friends who make healthy choices can motivate you to do the same and avoid peer pressure. <br>
				<u> How</u>: Choose friends who encourage you to be your best and avoid negative situations. If your friends pressure you to try substances, it’s important to seek out others who will support your healthy choices. A strong, positive support system makes it easier to say no to harmful activities. </p>

			<h2><strong> 3. Learn to manage stress </strong></h2>
				<p> <u> Why</u>: Stress and difficult emotions can make you more vulnerable to using substances as a way to cope or escape. Learning healthy ways to deal with stress reduces the temptation to rely on substances for comfort. <br>
				<u> How</u>: Practice healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercising, journaling, talking to a trusted friend, or using relaxation techniques like deep breathing. These coping methods not only help you feel better in tough situations but also build emotional resilience, making you less likely to turn to harmful substances for relief. </p>

                <h1 style="font-size: 30px;"><strong> <u> Ways to Help the People Around You from Substance Abuse </u> </strong></h1>
				<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Flearningmole.com%2Fimportance-of-open-communication-with-teachers%2F&psig=AOvVaw1Yny18yYKrE6QayFgU95LR&ust=1736597399149000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCIiz08uP64oDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">
                <img src="img2/open.png" alt="">
				</a>
                <h2><strong> 1. Encourage open communication </strong></h2>
				<p> <u> Why</u>: People struggling with substance abuse often feel isolated or judged, which makes it harder for them to seek help. Offering a safe space to talk can make a big difference. <br>
				<u> How</u>: Let them know you’re there for them without judgment. Ask how they’re feeling, listen actively, and avoid interrupting or criticizing. Showing empathy and understanding can encourage them to share their struggles and seek support. </p>
				
				<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seek.co.nz%2Fcareer-advice%2Farticle%2Fhobbies-and-interests-for-a-resume&psig=AOvVaw3BaxmvVDtdxMGGBSjHffys&ust=1736592690039000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCNjkkoX-6ooDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAg">
                <img src="img2/share.png" alt="">
				</a>
                <h2><strong> 2. Share reliable information about substance abuse </strong></h2>
				<p> <u> Why</u>: Many people underestimate the dangers of substance abuse or don’t understand its long-term consequences. Educating them can help them make informed decisions. <br>
				<u> How</u>: Research and share facts about how substance abuse affects health, relationships, and opportunities. Use simple words and focus on examples they can relate to, such as stories of others who overcame addiction. Sharing this knowledge can open their eyes to the risks and motivate them to make positive changes. </p>

                <img src="img2/prof.png" alt="">
				</a>
                <h2><strong> 3. Encourage seeking professional help </strong></h2>
				<p> <u> Why</u>: While support from friends and family is important, overcoming substance abuse often requires professional guidance. Experts can provide the right treatment and coping strategies. <br>
				<u> How</u>: Gently suggest reaching out to a counselor, therapist, or local support group. Offer to help them look for resources or accompany them to an appointment if they’re hesitant. This support shows that you care about their well-being and want them to succeed in overcoming their challenges.
